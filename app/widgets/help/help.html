	What is table-editor?
	</h2>

	<p>
	table-editor is a lightweight web application that enables <em>smart</em> CSV and TSV editing
	that is guided by a YAML configuration to provide autocomplete lookup and other assistance during the process of creating or editing portions of knowledge graphs in a tabular format. The constrained and assisted table editor ensures that the resulting CSV or TSV data is compatible with subsequent integration into a larger knowledgebase or ontology.
